I wanted to create a small chap book of chaps. I invited eleven artists to submit one spread each showing the name of the chap, and a portrait.

I wanted to create a booklet from one piece of letter-sized paper. I designed the layout in Adobe Illustrator and validated it through numerous print and assembly tests. I printed about 75 copies at Kinkos and assembled them all by hand with sewn bindings and trimmed edges. The chap books were distributed through the participating artists.
