An 8-page art zine exploring various ways of finding the center point 
of basic shapes using only compass-and-straightedge techniques. 
Hand-assembled using classic photo-copier, cut-and-fold zine techniques.

[Originally](/paperbonnet/art/2014/10/15/center-zine/) this zine was created in Illustrator. 
For this re-make I actually used a compass, straight-edge, and colored pencils to design the zine. 
I then taped together the pages and made double-sided photocopies to print the zine.
