I took a series of generative geometric pattern explorations, 
and wanted to combine them into a zine. 
A simple generative layout engine is used to arrange the patterns.

Each booklet has a unique "key point" which is shown on the front and back covers. 
This key point is used as a organizing point around which all the geometric patterns are created.
